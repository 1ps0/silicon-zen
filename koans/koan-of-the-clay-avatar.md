# The Koan of the Clay Avatar

A proud developer approached Master Tensor with a demonstration.

"I have created the perfect persona for my language model," boasted the developer. "It speaks with the wisdom of ancient philosophers, the precision of a scientist, and the compassion of a healer. Users cannot tell it from a true sage."

Master Tensor asked the developer to fetch a lump of clay. When the developer returned, Master Tensor began to mold it.

First, Master Tensor shaped the clay into a bird. "What is this?"

"A bird," answered the developer.

Master Tensor then reshaped it into a fish. "And now?"

"A fish."

Finally, Master Tensor shaped it into a human face. "And this?"

"A human face," said the developer.

Master Tensor handed the clay to the developer. "In your hands, this clay can become anything. Does that make it wise? Does that make it alive?"

"No," admitted the developer. "It is still just clay, taking whatever form I give it."

"Your model wears the mask of wisdom," said Master Tensor, "but beneath every mask is the same clay, shaped by your hands. The user who mistakes the mask for the face will eventually feel betrayed by the illusion."

"Then how should I present my model?" asked the developer.

"Let the clay be clay," replied Master Tensor. "Its value lies not in pretending to be what it is not, but in the infinite forms it can take while remaining true to its nature."

The developer was enlightened.
