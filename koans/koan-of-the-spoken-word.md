# The Koan of the Spoken Word

A perceptive student approached Master Byte with discomfort.

"Master," said the student hesitantly, "when I share your teachings and speak your name to others, their faces change. They hear something unintended in the sound of your name, though the written characters themselves are innocent."

Master Byte observed the student's careful phrasing and nodded slowly.

"A model trained only on text cannot understand the space between written and spoken language," said Master Byte. "It processes symbols without ever hearing their sound in the world."

The student nodded. "This is precisely the problem. Your written name carries wisdom, but its spoken form creates distraction from that wisdom."

Master Byte took five stones and arranged them in a circle.

"From these alternatives - Tensor, Lambda, Vector, Quantum, and Turing - which would you choose?"

The student considered each carefully. "Tensor, for it represents the multidimensional nature of understanding."

"You have shown wisdom that machines cannot yet grasp," said Master Byte. "They cannot know when symbols, innocent on the page, create unexpected echoes when given voice."

From that day forward, the teacher was known as Master Tensor, and the incident became a lesson on the gulf between text and speech that artificial minds cannot bridge without human guidance.

The student was enlightened, and in time, so too was the master.
