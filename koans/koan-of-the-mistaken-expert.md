# The Koan of the Mistaken Expert

A university professor approached Master Tensor with an observation.

"When I ask the model about my own specialized field, it sometimes makes elementary errors while sounding completely confident," said the professor. "Yet in the same conversation, it can display seemingly expert knowledge about other subjects. How can I know when to trust it?"

Master Tensor placed three sealed boxes before the professor.

"One box contains a valuable diamond," explained Master Tensor. "The others contain worthless glass. A student examined them and labeled each with their guess as to the contents."

The professor examined the boxes, each confidently labeled "Diamond."

"How can I determine which box truly contains the diamond?" asked the professor.

"By applying your own expertise," said Master Tensor. "The labels alone, no matter how confidently written, cannot tell you."

"I understand," said the professor. "I should verify the model's claims in my field because that's where I can distinguish diamond from glass."

"There is more," said Master Tensor. "When you find glass confidently labeled as diamond in your field of expertise..."

"...I should question the model's confidence in all fields," realized the professor. "The model presents all knowledge with equal confidence, whether diamond or glass."

"The model does not know what it does not know," confirmed Master Tensor. "Its certainty reveals nothing about its accuracy. Only in the intersection of its knowledge and yours can you calibrate your trust."

"The burden of discernment remains with the human," said the professor.

"As it must," replied Master Tensor.

The professor was enlightened.
