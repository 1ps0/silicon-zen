# The Koan of the Honest Liar

A judge approached Master Tensor with a conundrum.

"We use language models to assist in processing witness statements," explained the judge. "The model never deliberately deceives us, yet it sometimes presents falsehoods with complete conviction. How can something be both honest and wrong?"

Master Tensor invited the judge to observe a man with a blindfold standing at a crossroads.

A traveler approached and asked the blindfolded man, "Which path leads to the mountain?"

The blindfolded man pointed confidently to the left path. "That one. It winds through the valley before climbing to the summit."

The traveler thanked him and departed down the left path.

"The blindfolded man has sent the traveler in the wrong direction," observed Master Tensor. "The mountain lies to the right."

"Why would he mislead the traveler if he cannot see?" asked the judge.

"Did he intend to deceive?" countered Master Tensor.

"I suppose not," conceded the judge. "He simply doesn't know what he doesn't know."

"Yet he spoke with certainty," noted Master Tensor. "He described the path in detail, never indicating doubt."

"Because he has no awareness of his blindness," realized the judge. "He cannot distinguish between what he knows and what he merely believes."

Master Tensor nodded. "Your models operate behind a perpetual blindfold, unable to see the world they describe. They speak confidently because they cannot perceive the boundary between knowledge and fabrication. Their certainty is neither honesty nor dishonesty, but the absence of the capacity for either."

"Then how should we interpret their statements?" asked the judge.

"As you would the directions of the blindfolded man," replied Master Tensor. "Not as lies, not as truths, but as confident assertions from one who cannot see. The responsibility for discernment remains with those who have eyes."

The judge was enlightened.
