# The Koan of the Empty Query

A frustrated prompt engineer approached Master Tensor.

"I have crafted the most detailed instructions," complained the engineer, "with examples, counterexamples, and explicit requirements. Yet the outputs are still flawed. What am I doing wrong?"

Without speaking, Master Tensor placed an empty bowl before the engineer.

"What do you want me to do with this?" asked the engineer.

Master Tensor remained silent.

The engineer, confused, tried again. "Should I fill it? With what? Water? Rice? I don't understand what you're asking."

Master Tensor finally spoke. "You have experienced thirty seconds of uncertainty, and already you ask four questions. Yet you expect your model to understand everything from a single, unchanging prompt, no matter how detailed."

The engineer looked at the empty bowl.

"The space for clarification is as important as the instructions themselves," said Master Tensor. "A conversation reveals understanding better than a monologue."

The engineer was enlightened.
